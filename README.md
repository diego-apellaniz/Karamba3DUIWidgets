# Karamba3DUIWidgets
A breakdown example of different UI Widgets from the Grasshopper Plugin Karamba3d, displaying some structural functionalities through code.

The code of the GUI-Widgets comes from Karamba3D. They were developed by Christoph Zimmel in cooperation with Bollinger und Grohmann ZT GmbH in Vienna.

This repository has been created by Federico Chiavegati and Diego Apell√°niz to gather all the Widgets and make their code public, with authorization of the above mentioned original developers.

DummyExtendableSwitcher:
An example of an extendable component, built using a GH_SwitcherComponent class from the base Karamba components. The component provides a primary usage of scaling a given geometry and and multiple different extendable menus displaying a variety of menu concepts:

#### Extendable Menu
An extendable menu of inputs and outputs. This section hosts most of the outputs for the extendable component. The parameters for this section are used for a multiplication or additon output.

#### Drop Down Menu
A drop down menu example of values, the output for this section primarily identifies which drop down option was chosen.

#### CheckBoxes
A checkbox example, the output for this checkbox is a boolen determining if the given checkbox has been ticked.

#### RadioButton
Similar to a checkbox, a radiobutton acts as an individual check, meaning other tick boxes cannot be simultaneously ticked. The output for the radiobutton is an identifier for which radiobutton is currently ticked.

#### Slider
A value slider of two decimal places, the output reflects the slider value.

#### Static text
A plain text block

A switcher component is a menu that adapts inputs and outputs depending on the dropdown list option select. In this case, the list contains an options to create a scalable circle or a scalable square from varying parameters. The two options are defined in code as subcomponent classes and called by a primary class, allowing for individual definition of purposes.

DummyExtendableComponent:
A proof of concept extendable built with the GH_ExtendableCOmponent class. The method of defining input and output parameters differs to using a GH_SwitcherComponent. The inputs and outputs reflect the same covered in the previous extendable component.
